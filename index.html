                monsters to protect mankind from certain annihilation, a notoriously weak hunter named Sung Jinwoo finds
                himself in a seemingly endless struggle for survival. One day, after narrowly surviving an
                overwhelmingly powerful double dungeon that nearly wipes out his entire party, a mysterious program
                called the System chooses him as its sole player and in turn, gives him the unique ability to level up
                in strength. This is something no other hunter is able to do, as a hunter's abilities are set once they
                awaken. Jinwoo then sets out on a journey as he fights against all kinds of enemies, both man and
                monster, to discover the secrets of the dungeons and the true source of his powers.

                <h2>Jujutsu Kaisen</h2>
                <p>Jujutsu Kaisen (呪術廻戦, rgh. "Sorcery Battle")[b] is a Japanese manga series written and illustrated by
                    Gege Akutami. It has been serialized in Shueisha's shōnen manga magazine Weekly Shōnen Jump since
                    March 2018, with its chapters collected in 26 tankōbon volumes as of April 2024. The story follows
                    high school student Yuji Itadori as he joins a secret organization of Jujutsu Sorcerers to eliminate
                    a powerful Curse named Ryomen Sukuna, of whom Yuji becomes the host. Jujutsu Kaisen is a sequel to
                    Akutami's Tokyo Metropolitan Curse Technical School, serialized in Shueisha's Jump Giga from April
                    to July 2017, later collected in a tankōbon volume, retroactively titled as Jujutsu Kaisen 0, in
                    December 2018.

                    Jujutsu Kaisen is licensed for English-language release in North America by Viz Media, which has
                    published the manga in print since December 2019. Shueisha publishes the series in English on the
                    Manga Plus online platform. Two novels, written by Ballad Kitaguni, were published in May 2019 and
                    January 2020, respectively. A 24-episode anime television series adaptation produced by MAPPA, aired
                    on MBS from October 2020 to March 2021; a second season aired from July to December 2023. A sequel
                    covering the "Culling Game" arc has been announced. The anime is licensed by Crunchyroll for
                    streaming outside of Asia, which premiered an English dub in November 2020. The anime's original
                    soundtrack was released in April 2021.

                    By January 2024, the Jujutsu Kaisen manga had over 90 million copies in circulation, including
                    related novels, digital versions, and Jujutsu Kaisen 0, making it one of the best-selling manga
                    series of all time.
                    <br /><strong>Plot</strong>
                    <br />Yuji Itadori is an unnaturally physically strong high school student living in Sendai. On his
                    deathbed in June 2018, his grandfather instills two powerful messages within Yuji: "always help
                    others" and "die surrounded by people". Yuji's friends at the Occult Club attract Curses to their
                    school when they unseal a rotten finger talisman. Yuji swallows the finger to protect Jujutsu
                    Sorcerer Megumi Fushiguro, becoming host to a powerful Curse named Ryomen Sukuna. Due to Sukuna's
                    evil nature, all sorcerers are required to exorcise him (and, by extension, Yuji) immediately.
                    However upon seeing Yuji retaining control over his body, Megumi's teacher Satoru Gojo brings him to
                    the Tokyo Prefectural Jujutsu High School with a proposal to his superiors: postpone Yuji's death
                    sentence and train under Gojo until he consumes all 20 of Sukuna's fingers so the Curse can be
                    eliminated. At the same time, a group of Cursed Spirits plot a multi-layered attack on the world of
                    Jujutsu sorcery, including the Cursed Spirit Mahito and a corrupted sorcerer named Suguru Geto, who
                    was executed by Gojo a year prior.

                    Gojo partners Yuji and Megumi with fellow first-year Tokyo student Nobara Kugisaki, training them to
                    become sorcerers, but during a mission gone wrong, Sukuna gains full control of Yuji's body, so Yuji
                    allows the both of them to die. Despite this, Sukuna brings Yuji back to life, having grown an
                    interest in Megumi. Aware the Jujutsu high-ups intend to kill Yuji, Gojo keeps his resurrection a
                    secret to continue training him. On a mission with experienced Jujutsu Sorcerer Kento Nanami, Yuji
                    meets fellow student Junpei Yoshino, who falls victim to Mahito's manipulations, leading Yuji to
                    swear vengeance.

                    Gojo reveals Yuji being alive during the exchange event between the Tokyo and Kyoto Jujutsu schools.
                    The Kyoto school's principal wants Yuji dead immediately so schemes to get it done, while the Tokyo
                    students help Yuji. During the event, Cursed Spirits attack the schools, but are fought off by Yuji,
                    Gojo, and third-year Kyoto student Aoi Todo, though Mahito steals three "Death Paintings"
                    (half-human half-Curses), and summons them.

                    After Yuji is able to consume several of Sukuna's fingers and kill two of the Death Paintings with
                    Nobara's help, disfigured second-year Kyoto student Kokichi Muta, who controls the Cursed Corpse
                    Mechamaru, is revealed to be a mole working with Geto and Mahito. Muta betrays them to protect his
                    friends, only to be killed by Mahito. On Halloween, the Cursed Spirits unleash their ultimate plan
                    by releasing several barriers over Shibuya. Gojo exorcises various Cursed Spirits, but is sealed
                    away by Geto in a special artifact, the Prison Realm. The events also reveal that the current Geto
                    is not the original but rather Geto's corpse possessed by an ancient sorcerer named Kenjaku.

                    Yuji and his allies face Kenjaku's forces in order to rescue Gojo. Yuji faces Choso, the third Death
                    Painting sibling, and is defeated, only to be spared due to Choso receiving a vision revealing they
                    are brothers. The Cursed Spirit Jogo force-feeds Yuji ten fingers, re-awakening Sukuna, who kills
                    Jogo and destroys a massive portion of the city. Mahito kills Nanami and mortally wounds Nobara, but
                    with the help of Todo, Yuji is able to defeat him. Kenjaku absorbs Mahito, and using his Cursed
                    Technique, re-awakens thousands of new sorcerers throughout Japan that Kenjaku had been planting for
                    thousands of years, as well as unleashing a slew of Curses to usher in chaos and a world of Cursed
                    Spirits reminiscent of the Heian period, the prime period of Jujutsu Sorcerers.

                    In the aftermath, the Jujutsu higher-ups sentence Yuji to death, with second-year student Yuta
                    Okkotsu appointed as his executioner, but Yuta helps Yuji fake his death. Yuji and Megumi team up
                    with Yuta and experienced sorcerer Yuki Tsukumo, both being special grade Jujutsu Sorcerers, along
                    with Choso and second-year student Maki Zen'in to meet Master Tengen, an immortal, part-Curse
                    part-human Jujutsu Sorcerer. Tengen reveals Kenjaku's plan to merge the former's consciousness with
                    Japan's human population using "the Culling Games", a battle royale between all the awakened
                    sorcerers to accumulate a massive amount of Cursed Energy allowing him to achieve this goal.

                    Maki goes to the Zen'in compound to collect Cursed Tools to assist in the fight, but is forced to
                    kill her entire clan when they lay a trap for her. Meanwhile, Yuji, Yuta, Megumi, second-year
                    student Panda, and third-year student Kinji Hakari, seek out a mysterious woman named "Angel" who
                    can free Gojo from the Prison Realm, as well as find a way to rescue Megumi's step-sister, Tsumiki,
                    from participating in the Games.

                    The group discovers Angel and that the Culling Games serve its purpose in acquiring a surplus of
                    Cursed Energy for Kenjaku's plans; he succeeds in killing Yuki and capturing Tengen. They then learn
                    that Tsumiki has become a host for a reincarnated sorcerer, and Sukuna uses this opportunity to
                    execute his ultimate plan: taking control of Megumi's body. He succeeds, kills Tsumiki, and regroups
                    with Kenjaku. The main group are able to use Angel's power to free Gojo from the Prison Realm. Gojo,
                    now unsealed, agrees with Sukuna and Kenjaku to fight on December 24.

                    Gojo faces off against Sukuna and Megumi's Ten Shadows, managing to beat them, however, Sukuna
                    survives and slices Gojo in half, killing him. The rest of the sorcerers, including Yuji (who, with
                    Choso's approval, consumed the remaining Death Paintings), soon join in the battle, with Sukuna
                    reviving himself to his true form in the process. Meanwhile, as Kenjaku is tracking down the
                    remaining Culling Game players, he is confronted by Fumihiko Takaba, an unexpectedly powerful
                    sorcerer that proves as an effective distraction, allowing Yuta to catch him off guard and
                    decapitate him. However, Kenjaku manages to escape via summoning an army of curses, and although
                    Yuta kills him, he adds a rule that allows Sukuna to become the Culling Games' master. Yuta goes to
                    assist Yuji, who is struggling against Sukuna. After a struggle, Yuta activates his Domain
                    Expansion: True and Mutual Love. This acts as a distraction as Yuji attempts to remove Sukuna from
                    Megumi. However, Megumi has lost all will to live, so the plan to save him has failed. Maki then
                    stabs Sukuna as she joins the fight. Maki seems to have the upper hand but Sukuna takes her out of
                    the fight. The second year instructor Kusakabe fights Sukuna but loses despite holding his own.
                    Miguel, Yuta's mentor, reunites with him. Sukuna does not recognize him and they prepare to fight.
                    In a flashback, Gojo reveals that if he and Miguel were to fight with no Cursed Techniques but with
                    Cursed Energy reinforcement, Miguel would win in point movement. Later, Yuji and Maki come back to
                    the fight and Sukuna uses Black Flash four times consecutively.
